if using .querySelector on a class that is repeated in other elements, only the first will be selected.

Ex: <button class="btn">Button 1</button>
<button class="btn">Button 2</button>
<button class="btn">Button 3</button>

document.querySelector('.btn') will only select "Button 1"
instead, use querySelectorAll. returns node list

creating a loop for a list can allow you to add event listeners to each instance of the loop

keyboard events generate objects that can be drilled into to retrieve information. ie: which key was pressed
